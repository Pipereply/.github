# Pipereply

**We build the technology layer that lets trade and energy businesses run on autopilot.**

Pipereply is a Software-With-A-Service (SWaS) company specialising in CRM automation, AI integration, and custom workflow engineering for trade services and solar businesses. We don't sell generic software — we design, build, and operate complete technology ecosystems tailored to how our clients actually work.

## What We Do

Most businesses are drowning in disconnected tools, manual data entry, and missed follow-ups. We fix that.

We take GoHighLevel — one of the most powerful CRM and automation platforms available — and transform it into a purpose-built operating system for your business. On top of that foundation, we layer AI agents, custom integrations, and automation architecture that connects every tool in your stack into a single, intelligent system.

The result: leads are captured and followed up automatically, proposals flow seamlessly between systems, jobs get created without anyone touching a keyboard, and your team spends their time on work that actually matters.

## Our Flagship Product — Solar AI-Q

**Solar AI-Q** is our purpose-built CRM and automation platform for solar companies.

It combines a fully configured GoHighLevel sub-account with a suite of AI agents, deep third-party integrations, and workflow automation designed specifically for the solar sales and installation pipeline — from first enquiry through to post-installation review.

## Our Approach

We are not a CRM reseller. We are a technology partner.

Every client engagement starts with understanding your business process — how leads come in, how they're qualified, how proposals are made, how jobs are delivered. We then design an automation architecture that mirrors and accelerates that process, eliminating the friction and manual work that slows most businesses down.

We build for scale. Everything we design is intended to grow with your business, not break when you hire your fifth salesperson or add your third integration.

**Core principles we apply to every build:**
- Automate everything that can be automated
- Eliminate manual data entry wherever possible
- Design for auditability — always know what happened and when
- Build integrations that are resilient, modular, and maintainable
- Use AI to reduce labour cost, not to replace human judgment

## This Organisation

This GitHub organisation houses the technical infrastructure behind Pipereply's products and client implementations.

Most repositories here are private. Occasionally, we open-source tooling, utilities, or reference implementations that may be useful to the broader developer community. If something is public, it is intended to be — and we maintain it accordingly.
